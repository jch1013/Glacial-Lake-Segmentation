# 🏔️ Glacial Lake Segmentor
Using AI to identify glacial lakes from satellite imagery.

## Overview
**Glacial Lake Segmentor** is a machine learning project designed to detect glacial lakes from satellite images using semantic segmentation techniques. Born from my love for hiking and alpine landscapes, this project is both a personal exploration tool and a technical deep-dive into geospatial AI.

The goal was to automate the discovery of new glacial lakes (potential hiking spots) while building practical experience with deep learning, remote sensing data, and image segmentation workflows.

## Key Features
- Integration with [Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/) API to fetch high-resolution satellite imagery
- UNet-based image segmentation using PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras
- Preprocessing pipeline for satellite images (e.g., cloud filtering, normalization)
- Output masks highlighting likely glacial lake regions
- Model evaluation on hold-out datasets with basic metrics (Jaccard score, Dice score)

## Tech Stack
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **ML & Data:** NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, OpenCV
- **APIs & Tools:** Sentinel Hub API, matplotlib

## What I Learned
- Developed a deeper understanding of semantic segmentation architectures, especially UNet
- Gained practical experience working with real-world satellite imagery and remote sensing data
- Learned to integrate disparate tools like satellite APIs, geospatial libraries, and deep learning frameworks into a cohesive workflow

## Future Improvements
- 🔁 Train on a larger and more geographically diverse dataset
- 🧠 Further model fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization
- 🌍 Potential integration with GIS platforms for route planning

## Why I Built This
As someone who enjoys exploring alpine regions, I wanted a tool that could help me discover new glacial lakes and backcountry destinations. This project let me combine that passion with my growing interest in machine learning and geospatial analysis.
